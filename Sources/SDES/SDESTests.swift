The test initializes all keys to zero. Each block of data input into the S-DEA is represented as a 8-bit basis vector.

     This test is repeated 8 times, using the 8 input basis vectors, allowing for every possible basis vector to be tested. At the completion of the 8th cycle, all results are verified for correctness.

     If correct results are obtained from an IUT, the Variable Plaintext Known Answer Test has verified the initial permutation IP and the expansion matrix E via the encrypt operation by presenting a full set of basis vectors to IP and to E. The test also verifies the inverse permutation IP-1 via the decrypt operation. It does this by presenting the recovered basis vectors to IP-1.

     To perform the Inverse Permutation Known Answer Test, the test supplies the IUT with initial values for the key, the plaintext(s) and, if applicable, the initialization vector(s).

     This test performs the same processing as the Variable Plaintext Known Answer Test. The difference is that the plaintext value(s) for this test are set to the ciphertext result(s) obtained from the Variable Plaintext Known Answer Test for the corresponding modes of operation.

     The key is initialized to zero. This key is a self-dual key. A self-dual key is a key with the property that when you encrypt twice with this key, the result is the initial input. Therefore, the result is the same as encrypting and decrypting with the same key. Using a self-dual key allows basis vectors to be presented to components of the S-DEA to validate the IUTâ€™s performance. This is discussed further in the last paragraph of this section.

     This test, when applied to an IUT, verifies the inverse permutation (IP-1) via the encrypt operation, because as the basis vectors are recovered, each basis vector is presented to the inverse permutation IP-1. By performing the decrypt operation, the initial permutation IP and the expansion matrix E are verified by presenting the full set of basis vectors to them as well.

The other modes of operation only require one plaintext variable.

     When this test is performed for an IUT, the 10 possible key basis vectors which yield unique keys are presented to PC1, verifying the key permutation PC1 via the encrypt operation. Also, during the encrypt operation, a complete set of key basis vectors is presented to PC2 as well, so PC2 is verified.
